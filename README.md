# Spell-Check-Team-5

This project is currently in beta version development stage.


The algorithm uses Bayesian spelling correction approach
An input text file(we used novels from project gutenberg) that idealy covers all words in english is read by the algorithm


PS: Our team is still working on the text file that ideally covers all the words in english for better results
